/**
 * MiniGame handler class.
 *
 * Purpose:
 *  - Acts as a central manager for mini-game lifecycle 
 *    (creation, drawing, disposal).
 *  - Provides a single integration point so the application 
 *    can interact with mini-games without needing to know 
 *    their internal details.
 *
 * Current state:
 *  - Supports only one mini-game instance (placeholder).
 *  - Core logic is not yet implemented; layout only.
 *
 * Future:
 *  - Will serve as a factory/loader for multiple mini-games.
 *  - Responsible for selecting which mini-game to create 
 *    based on game state, type, or level.
 *  - Ensures consistent lifecycle management (instantiate, 
 *    render, clean up) across all mini-game types.
